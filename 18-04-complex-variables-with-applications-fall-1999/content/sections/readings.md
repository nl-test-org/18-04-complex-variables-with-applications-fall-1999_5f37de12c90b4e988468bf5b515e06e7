{{< anchor "comments" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Comments on the Various Sections in the Book
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These comments concern the book only and aim at describing what I intend the course of the lectures to do relative to the book; I hope no major deviations are needed, but small deviations are sure to occur.

Sec. 1.1-1.5 Assigned reading. Will also cover in the lectures.

Sec. 2.1-2.5

Sec. 3.1-3.2

Sec. 3.3 Assigned reading, probably will not cover in the lectures.

Sec. 4.1

Sec. 4.2 Will cover in class in an "intuitive" fashion. Make sure you also read the more formal exposition in the book.

Sec. 4.3 Assigned reading. Will also cover in the lectures.

_First exam will include material up to approximately this point._

Sec. 4.4 The Lectures here will follow a different approach from the two alternative ones given in the book. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you familiarize yourself with ALL THREE versions.

Sec. 4.5 THIS SECTION and the preceding one are FUNDAMENTAL. Be sure to study and understand them thoroughly.

Sec. 4.6 Assigned reading. Will also cover in the lectures.

Sec. 4.7 Will probably cover at best lightly in the lectures, but I recommend that you read it and acquire familiarity with it.

Sec. 5.1-5.2 Assigned reading. Will also cover in the lectures.

Sec. 5.3 Will probably cover only lightly in the lectures, but you should take a careful look at it. Even if you do not study the proofs in detail, the results are important.

Sec. 5.4 Most of the proofs here are for the adventure minded, i.e. optional, except for any I stress in the lectures). BUT, read the theorem statements --- which will be covered in the lectures, mostly. In particular, those of you that never heard of Cauchy's criterion: see Theorem 12!

Sec. 5.5 Assigned reading. Will also cover in the lectures.

Sec. 5.6 Do not miss Theorem 18, at the end of this section.

Sec. 5.7 By the time we get this far; this section will have been covered as part of the prior lectures. I will not "do it again", but you should read the section now.

Sec. 5.8 Some stuff in this section is not part of the course --- but I encourage the more audacious to read it all anyway. Other stuff will be covered in the lectures.

Summary, chapter 5: Read it, please.

Sec. 6.1-6.4 Assigned reading. Will also cover in the lectures.

_Second exam will include material up to approximately this point._

Sec. 6.5-6.7 Assigned reading. Will also cover in the lectures.

Sec. 7.1-7.7

Sec. 8.1

Sec. 3.4 At this point the material in this section will become relevant. You should take a look at it.

Sec. 8.2-8.3 Assigned reading. Will also cover in the lectures.

_Third exam will include material up to this point (Course end)._
