MATLAB® Tutorial ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/tools/matlab_tutorial))

Course MATLAB® Scripts
----------------------

The MATLAB® scripts used in the course (sometimes in the lectures directly, other times as suggested extras). The scripts are (mostly, one hopes) user friendly and come with the MATLAB® help feature enabled (and plenty more buried in the comments inside the codes).

The scripts are an integral part of the course. The students are expected to use them extensively.

Further information can be found at:

A. [Introductory notes provided by Indiana University](http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath/math/matlab/)

> Ignore the Indiana-specific information.

B. "[A Practical Introduction to MATLAB®](http://www.math.mtu.edu/~msgocken/intro/intro.html)"

> It is a good starting. The section on "Simple calculations and graphs" is particularly appropriate for help in getting started.

I hope this is helpful.
