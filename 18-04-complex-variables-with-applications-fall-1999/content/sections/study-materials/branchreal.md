Figure 1: Real part of the Principal Vale of the cube root.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Real part of the Principal Part branch of the cubic root function on the complex plane. Notice the lack of smoothness along the negative real axis (the branch cut), where the surface has a corner.

Picture obtained using the script PlotCube in the Athena 18.04 MATLAB® Toolkit.
